- **Search:** Enter the name of a city or location to retrieve its weather information.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js:** A React framework that enables server-side rendering and provides an efficient, developer-friendly environment for building web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling and designing the app faster and more maintainable.
- **Flowbite:** A component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, offering pre-designed UI components to help speed up development.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and provides better tooling for catching errors.
